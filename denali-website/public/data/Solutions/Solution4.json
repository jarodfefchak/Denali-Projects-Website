      "description": "As part of a 150 MMSCFD sour gas facility scope that Denali was working on for our midstream client, Denali was responsible for the design of the site's new gathering, sales, and water disposal pipelines. This included six sour gas gathering lines, two sales lines, two fuel gas lines, and one water disposal line, totaling over 130 km. Additionally, this project involved managing the tie-ins for numerous producers and sales points along these pipelines.",
