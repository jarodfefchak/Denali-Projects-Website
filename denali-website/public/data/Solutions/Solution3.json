    "description": "Denali was responsible for the design of site-wide piping, equipment packages and utilities for a greenfield water disposal terminal. Included truck in packages, tank farm, water filtration building, pump packages, multistage high pressure injection pumps, and flare system.  Included a 4km water injection pipeline and disposal well.  Reviewed the feasibility of using natural gas, propane, or diesel for power generation options. Design of the site fuel gas system (including conditioning) and sourcing generators to provide site power before permanent power was installed. Site-wide electrical design, equipment packages and electrical house for a greenfield water disposal terminal. Denali incorporated a 1.5MW utility transformer with a cable bus design to feed multiple 400HP water injection pumps. Oversaw electrical design and power studies including harmonic calculations, breaker settings, coordination curves and arc flash calculations. \n Denali would go on to expand the facility adding increased water handling capabilities, incoming water and fuel gas pipelines, and additional high pressure injection pumps, pipeline and disposal well.
