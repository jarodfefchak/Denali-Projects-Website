    "description": "The scope of this expansion project involved adding new truck-in packages and tanks to an existing water disposal facility. Denali facilitated the design of additional water filtration buildings, multistage high-pressure injection pumps, and integrated systems with the current flare infrastructure. The expansion included a 3 km water injection pipeline and an associated disposal well. Our team oversaw the electrical design and conducted power studies, which included harmonic calculations, breaker settings, coordination curves, and arc flash analyses.",

    "description": "Our team designed site-wide piping, equipment packages, and utilities for a greenfield water disposal terminal, which included truck-in packages, a tank farm, a water filtration building, pump packages, multistage high-pressure injection pumps, a flare system, and a 4 km water injection pipeline to a disposal well. We evaluated power generation options like natural gas, propane, and diesel, and designed a fuel gas system along with generators for temporary power. The project featured a 1.5 MW utility transformer supporting multiple 400 HP water injection pumps and encompassed electrical design and power studies, including harmonic calculations and arc flash assessments.\nDenali later expanded the facility, enhancing its water handling capacity and adding incoming water and fuel gas pipelines, along with additional high-pressure injection pumps and a disposal well.",

    "description": "For this greenfield water disposal terminal, Denali focused on the design of site-wide piping, equipment packages, and utilities. The project included truck-in packages, a tank farm, a water filtration building, pump packages, and high-pressure injection pumps, along with the site fuel gas and flare systems. The infrastructure was designed to support piping leading to an on-site disposal well. The electrical design featured a 1.5 MW utility transformer with a cable bus system to operate a single 400 HP water injection pump. Comprehensive electrical studies were conducted to address harmonic calculations, breaker settings, coordination curves, and arc flash parameters.",

    "description": "Our client urgently needed to add emulsion treating capacity to an existing facility. Denali reviewed available stock treaters and ancillary equipment to identify a fit-for-purpose solution that could be installed and integrated as quickly as possible. The scope included reviewing and integrating the new treater into the existing facility while maintaining the required spacing from other surrounding equipment.",

    "description": "Denali was responsible for the full-service engineering and procurement of a new 175,000 BBL asphalt tank to an existing refinery. This included working with the site’s existing products and utility systems, as well as tying in for tank heating. Denali also re-designed multiple existing tank farms to assist in more efficient rail and truck loading systems. Significant civil and earthwork modifications were required to the facility to accommodate the new 175,000 BBL tank including design for removal of contaminated soil, new fill and containment wall. In addition to tank farm modifications Denali expanded and modified existing MCC, E-Houses and control rooms.",
