    "description": "Denali was responsible for the redevelopment of an existing 100MMSCFD sour gas facility to handle new producer gas volumes. Scope included new refrigeration unit, heat medium, 3.6MW total of generators, bullet storage, truck unloading and upgraded sweetening system packages as well as several utility systems upgrades. From the electrical side, Denali was responsible for the power generation integration plan, medium voltage development plan, and controls system development plan. Denali prepared a total installed cost estimate and evaluation including numerous engineering documents for the proposed brownfield facility improvements. "

    "description": "Denali evaluated the feasibility of installing power generation for the client at 6 of its sites to isolate from the utility grid to reduce operating costs. This included an evaluation of existing and future loads, selection of technology (turbine vs. reciprocating generators) preliminary block flow diagrams and Class 4 estimates for each site to evaluate economics of the proposed facilities. The sites ranged from 1 to 6 MW of required power production. "

    "description": "Our client was upgrading the capacity of an existing compressor station to increase gas throughput to 25mmscf/d. The upgrade required relocating equipment from an existing facility. The equipment included two gas driven compressor with coolers, condensate pump skid and conditioner vessel, line heater, 36” dehy package, coalescer skid, knockout skid, inlet separator skid and MCC building. To provide power to the relocated compression equipment a 3 x 535 kW generator package was refurbished and integrated. Denali completed the electrical and controls design for the compressor station relocation and the generator integration."
