    "description": "As part of an optimization and modernization plan, Denali conducted a comprehensive FEED study to upgrade an aging electrical distribution system. The 60-year-old infrastructure required a plan to replace a 25 kV substation and outdoor equipment with a new utility feeder and a 5 kV E-house. This modernization aims to prevent unplanned outages by replacing equipment before it fails. During the development of the DBM, cost estimates, and schedule, special attention was given to planning strategic outages to minimize facility downtime during construction. A 60% model, integrated with a point cloud model, ensured that the FEED design remained practical as the project progressed into detailed engineering."

    "description": "Denali provided the electrical, controls, and instrumentation engineering for a greenfield 150 MMSCFD sour gas plant. Deliverables included a budgetary procurement and 30% design of 5 kV switchgear and MCCs, power transformers, 5 kV VFDs, 600 V MCCs, DCS control systems, five electrical buildings, and 45 process skids. The FEED established the foundation for the multi-year detailed design currently under construction."

    "description": "Denali provided comprehensive mechanical design services for a remote power plant capable of generating 1.8 MW of local grid power using LNG and diesel fuels. The scope included evaluating various configurations and fuel options to support economic assessments for the end user. We developed numerous cost estimates for a variety of engine brands, sizes, and fuel types, including dedicated diesel, LNG, and bi-fuel units, for economic evaluation. We also developed specifications and equipment RFP packages for three genset packages, all of which featured a jacket water heat recovery system to optimize energy efficiency."

    "location": "Prince Rupert, BC – Greenfield",
    "description": "Denali coordinated FEED engineering and regulatory support on behalf of its client for a greenfield marine terminal. The terminal products included LPG, methanol, and clean petroleum products, which are brought in by rail, stored, and pumped to ships at a new marine jetty/loading dock. The refrigerated LPG storage tank has a volume of 90,000 m³, while the 18 total methanol and clean petroleum product tanks range from 30,000 m³ to 40,000 m³ in volume. This involved coordination and review of documents and drawings for all aspects of the FEED, including rail, facility, and marine deliverables."

    "location": " Outside Grande Prairie, AB – Greenfield ",
    "description": "Denali coordinated FEED engineering and regulatory support on behalf of its client for a greenfield 100 MMSCFD sour gas facility. This included the complete demolition and remediation of an existing smaller facility on the site lease. The project scope included a refrigeration unit, amine sweetening, a heat medium system, liquids tank and bullet storage, and truck out stations. This involved coordination and document and drawing reviews for all aspects of the FEED."

    "location": ": Moose Jaw, SK - Brownfield",
    "description": "Denali performed a FEED study, detailed engineering, installation, and construction support at an existing refinery for multiple automation projects that increased efficiency, optimized operations, and reduced risk at the facility. The project was completed in four stages: Tank Farm Valve Automation, Scale and Truck Automation, and Refinery Plant Mass Balance.\n\n The Tank Farm Valve Automation scope involved automating the existing six tank farms to improve functionality for directing the flow of refined products to multiple tank farms, pipelines, and rail or truck loading areas of the facility. \n\nThe scale house automation scope aimed to automate the custody transfer process for the trucking program at the refinery. Prior to the project, operations were manual, requiring continuous operational assistance to generate truck tickets. This process was automated and integrated into the plant control system. \n\nThe Refinery Plant Mass Balance scope consisted of identifying, replacing, and adding flow meters and computers to the existing plant control system to assist with live and accurate volumetric readings for plant balancing. There was an estimated discrepancy between the refinery inlet and outlet that has been corrected through the project."
