    "description": "Denali was responsible for the redevelopment of an existing 100MMSCFD sour gas facility to handle new producer gas volumes. Scope included new refrigeration unit, heat medium, 3.6MW total of generators, bullet storage, truck unloading and upgraded sweetening system packages as well as several utility systems upgrades. From the electrical side, Denali was responsible for the power generation integration plan, medium voltage development plan, and controls system development plan. Denali prepared a total installed cost estimate and evaluation including numerous engineering documents for the proposed brownfield facility improvements. "

    "description": "Denali evaluated the feasibility of installing power generation for the client at 6 of its sites to isolate from the utility grid to reduce operating costs. This included an evaluation of existing and future loads, selection of technology (turbine vs. reciprocating generators) preliminary block flow diagrams and Class 4 estimates for each site to evaluate economics of the proposed facilities. The sites ranged from 1 to 6 MW of required power production. "
