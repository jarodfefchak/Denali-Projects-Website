    "description": "Denali was responsible for the full-service engineering and procurement of a new 175,000 BBL asphalt tank to an existing refinery. This included working with the siteâ€™s existing products and utility systems, as well as tying in for tank heating. Denali also re-designed multiple existing tank farms to assist in more efficient rail and truck loading systems. Significant civil and earthwork modifications were required to the facility to accommodate the new 175,000 BBL tank including design for removal of contaminated soil, new fill and containment wall. In addition to tank farm modifications Denali expanded and modified existing MCC, E-Houses and control rooms."
