    "title": "175,000 BBL TANK ADDITION IN SASKATCHEWAN",
    "description": "Denali Projects’ client had several smaller tanks in a tank farm at their existing refinery that required replacing due to their age and were affecting facility throughput.  After completing a FEED for the replacement of the tanks, Denali Projects was responsible for the full-service engineering and procurement of a new 175,000 BBL asphalt tank to replace these smaller outdated tanks. \nOne of the main challenges with the project was maintaining facility run time of the facilities processing capabilities, and rail and truck loading activities, while removing and integrating the new tank.  This was accomplished though several phases in which the site’s existing products and utility systems had to be retoured and altered.  Denali Projects also re-designed multiple existing tank farms to assist in more efficient rail and truck loading systems while building the new tank and for continued operations after the tank was completed.\nSignificant civil and earthwork modifications were required to the facility to accommodate the new 175,000 BBL tank to accommodate a small footprint, including design for removal of contaminated soil, new fill and containment wall. In addition to tank farm modifications, Denali Projects expanded and modified existing MCC, E-Houses and control rooms to accommodate the new loads of the addition.\n"
