    "description": "Denali Projectsâ€™ client needed to replace aging tanks in their refinery's tank farm, which were impacting throughput. After completing a FEED study, our team was tasked with engineering and procuring a new 175,000 BBL asphalt tank to replace the smaller outdated tanks.\nA major challenge was to maintain continuous facility operations, including rail and truck loading, during the integration of the new tank. This involved multiple phases of modifications to existing products and utility systems. Denali also redesigned the tank farm to improve efficiency in rail and truck loading while ensuring ongoing operations.\nThe project required significant civil and earthwork modifications to accommodate the new tank within a limited footprint, including removing contaminated soil and constructing a new fill and containment wall. Additionally, we expanded and updated existing MCCs, E-Houses, and control rooms to support the increased operational demands.\n"
