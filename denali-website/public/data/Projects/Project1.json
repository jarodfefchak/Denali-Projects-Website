    "title": "100 MMSCFD GAS PLANT REDEVELOPMENT IN NE BC",
    "description": "The owner of the existing facility was to receive new volumes of natural gas and desired an increase in the recovery of Natural Gas Liquids from the new source.  From FEED, through detailed design and construction and commissioning support, Denali designed the numerous modifications and additions that were required within a very tight existing facility footprint.\nThe modifications and additions included the removal and replacement of an existing refrigeration system, the addition of additional power generation, NGL storage bullets/shipping pumps/truck loading and electrical buildings.\nMany of the facilitiesâ€™ existing features were modified to reduce the OPEX costs of the facility.  Notable upgrades were waste heat recovery units on the natural gas driven sales compressors, complete overhaul of the heat medium package to change the fluid type, and modifications of the existing amine contactor tower and ancillary vessels to allow for the use of a non-regenerative sweetening chemical.\n"
