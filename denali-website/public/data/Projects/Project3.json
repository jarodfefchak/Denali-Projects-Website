    "title": "LPG Export Terminal on the West Coast of BC",
    "description": "Denali was a key contributor in designing ship loading infrastructure for Canada's first LPG terminal on the West Coast. Our scope focused on process, mechanical, and electrical instrumentation and control (EI&C) engineering for the Jetty, which included over 7 km of combined piping for ship loading and utilities. A significant portion of this piping was integrated with the existing coal loading infrastructure of nearby facilities.\nAdditionally, Denali was responsible for integrating various utilities at the terminal, including incoming fuel gas, ground flare, and firewater systems.\n"
